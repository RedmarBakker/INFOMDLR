# (a) Choose a suitable deep learning model for the involved classification tasks. Justify your choice.
# (b) Compare the accuracy of the 2 types of classification, i.e. intra-subject and cross subject data using your model. Explain your results.
# (c) Explain the choices of hyper-parameters of your model architecture and analyze their influence on the results (for both 2 types of classification). How they are selected?
# (d) If there is a significant difference in training and testing accuracies, what could be a possible reason? What are the alternative models or approaches you would select? Select one and implement to further improve your results. Justify your choice.
